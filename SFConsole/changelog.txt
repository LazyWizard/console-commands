=========================
MASSIVE changes made to the code base for this release - please report any bugs!
New features:
 - The console can now be used in combat or when the game is paused/in menus
 - Full mission support (load a campaign save first to use your custom settings)
 - You can now issue multiple commands at once (separate with a semicolon)
 - Should work out of the box with all mods that don't overwrite generators.csv
New campaign commands:
 - AddAptitudePoints: adds aptitude points to your character
 - AddSkillPoints: adds skill points to your character
 - RunCode: compiles and runs a line of Java code (uses Janino)

 - InfiniteAmmo: toggles infinite ammo for your side
 - NoCooldown: toggles cooldown for all weapons on your side
 - Reveal/Unreveal: reveals/unreveals the entire battle map
Modder-specific changes:
 - Changed how commands are handled, uses reflection instead of being hard-coded
 - User-made/mod-specific commands can now be registered with the console
 - Most code is now stored in console.jar - source is included in the jar
 - Console variable storage/retrieval is now type-safe
 - Added protected Class getVarType(String varName) to Console and BaseCommand
