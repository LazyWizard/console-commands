For more information on a specific command, enter 'help <command>' (some hardcoded commands such as alias or status don't have helpfiles). To enter multiple commands, separate them with a semicolon. Add aliases with 'alias <name> <list of commands to execute>'. The console can be re-bound by pressing Shift+F1 on the campaign map.\n\nCompatible with all mods that don't replace generators.csv.",
