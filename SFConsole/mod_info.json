  "description":"An in-game developer's console, activated by default with tilde (~). For a complete list of commands, enter 'help' into the input box. For more information on a specific command, enter 'help <command>' (some hardcoded commands such as alias or status don't have helpfiles). To enter multiple commands, separate them with a semicolon. Add aliases with 'alias <name> <list of commands to execute>'. The console can be re-bound by pressing Shift+F1 on the campaign map.\n\nCompatible with all mods that don't replace generators.csv, though you can force it to work in total conversions with the 'addconsole' command.",
