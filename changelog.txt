 2.0 (someday)
===============
(this version is not save compatible with earlier versions)
LazyLib is now required for this mod to function!
Total rewrite of the mod:
 - No longer multi-threaded (fixes a load of problems the old mod had)
 - Utility mod, can be toggled at will, works with total conversions
Made writing custom commands much simpler:
 - Existing custom commands will no longer work, will need to be rewritten
 - Commands must implement the org.lazywizard.console.BaseCommand interface
 - Commands are registered inside data/console/console_commands.csv
   - Commands can be in any package now, not just data.scripts.console
   - This update adds support for commands in a jar
Changes to existing commands:
 - Rewrote all commands to use new BaseCommand interface
 - Removed RunScript command (considering RunCode it's pretty superfluous)

========================
Toggleable combat commands can now be used on the campaign map
Certain non-combat commands can now be used in battles (Alias, GC, RunCode, etc)
You can now copy your console settings to a new savefile:
 (this process will be improved in future versions)
 - Step 1: start a new game without this mod active, save and quit
 - Step 2: activate this mod, load the save with the settings you want
 - Step 3: without exiting the game, load the new save from step 1
 - Step 4: use the AddConsole command to activate the console on that save

 1.4 (January 17, 2012)
========================
The cursor for the console pop-up is now visible
Fixed bug: exception details not displayed when an error occurs
RunCode works again (ignores separators, can't be used with other commands)
Multiple changes to the alias command:

New in-battle commands:
