 2.5 (November 19, 2015)
=========================
Updated to be compatible with Starsector 0.7a
Updated custom command template with more examples + documentation
Changed some constants in CommonStrings, shouldn't affect any custom commands
Removed AddLogistics command (logistics no longer exists in current version)
New commands:
 - Clear, clears the text from the campaign pop-up
 - Flameout, disables all engines of current target
 - Rout, forces the enemy side into a full retreat
Changes to existing commands:
 - AddShip won't let you spawn fighter wings as ships anymore
 - AdjustRelationship and SetRelationship typo correction work properly now
 - InfiniteCR stops the CR timer from counting down, doesn't prevent bonuses
   from raising your current CR above the ship's maximum
 - ShowBounds optimized, doesn't draw in menus, also shows new elliptical target
   radius used by AI since 0.65.2a
 - SpawnFleet ensures there is at least 150 su of space between the player and
   the new fleet, pings the new fleet to show its position
 - SpawnFleet supports typo correction for faction argument
 - Added optional crew level argument to SpawnFleet command, made quality
   optional as well; syntax is now "spawnfleet <faction> <totalFleetPoints>
   [optionalQuality] [optionalCrewLevel] [optionalFleetName]"
   Examples of valid syntax:
    "spawnfleet hegemony 150"
    "spawnfleet hegemony 150 0.6"
    "spawnfleet hegemony 150 0.6 veteran"
    "spawnfleet hegemony 150 0.6 veteran System Defense Fleet"
 - Storage searches all markets for an unlocked storage tab, not just stations
 - Suicide works on the campaign map, destroys your entire fleet
 - Traitor swaps side of all members of a fighter wing
 - Traitor also affects any drones currently deployed by the selected ship
Greatly expanded the bundled Example Mod-Added Commands mini-mod:
 - This can be found in a zip in the main folder and contains sample
   implementations of some simple commands (mostly jokes)
 - Echo, the most basic example. Just prints the entered text to the console.
 - DogPile, causes all hostile fleets in the system to attempt to intercept
   the player
 - FlipShips, flips all ships on the battle map 180 degrees
 - FlakJacket, causes a constant circle of flak to rain around your flagship
 - ForeverAlone, prevents you from touching other fleets and vice versa

 2.4b (March 08, 2015)
=======================
Fixed crash when entering aliases in mixed case
New command:

 2.0 (who knows, I released it like eight times without incrementing version #)
================================================================================
(this version is not save compatible with earlier versions)
LazyLib is required for this mod to function!
The console is now summoned with control+backspace
 - This and other settings can be changed in data/console/console_settings.json
Total rewrite of the mod:
 - Core is no longer multi-threaded (fixes a load of problems the old mod had)
 - Utility mod, can be toggled at will, works with total conversions
 - Campaign input is handled through an interaction dialog, works in fullscreen
   (combat input still requires a popup and thus playing in windowed mode)
Made writing custom commands much simpler:
 - Existing custom commands will no longer work, will need to be rewritten
 - Commands must implement the org.lazywizard.console.BaseCommand interface
 - Commands are registered inside data/console/console_commands.csv
 - Commands can be in any package now, not just data.scripts.console
   (it is recommended that you DON'T put them in data/scripts, otherwise
    the game will try to load them even when the console mod isn't active)
 - A basic tutorial on writing custom commands is included in the mod folder
New commands:
 - AllHulls, adds one of each hull to a station's inventory
 - AllWings, adds one of each fighter wing to a station's inventory
 - Find, gives name and location of all entities in the campaign whose
   name contains the given arguments
 - Jump, teleports your fleet to another star system or hyperspace
 - InfiniteCR, prevents CR from draining during combat
 - Reload, reloads all console commands and settings
 - Repair, repairs hull/armor/cr of all ships in your fleet (in campaign),
   or hull/armor damage of all your currently fighting ships (in combat)
 - ShowBounds, toggles bounds rendering of all ships in combat
 - ShowLoc, shows coordinates of player ship/fleet in combat/campaign
 - SourceOf, shows what mod a specific command came from
 - Storage, opens a persistent, infinite-stack cargo/fleet container
Changes to existing commands:
 - Ported all old commands to the new BaseCommand interface
 - There are no more hard-coded commands - you can overwrite any core command
 - AllWeapons now defaults to 'storage' instead of player cargo if no
   arguments are passed in, won't go beyond 10 of each weapon
 - Home can now teleport your fleet between starsystems
 - RunCode catches all Exceptions so you don't need to squeeze a try-catch
   block into your arguments anymore
 - RunCode's imports are customizable, set in data/console/runcode_imports.csv
Removed the following old commands:
 - AddConsole, as the new ModPlugin system makes it unnecessary
 - GC, anyone who knows enough Java to know what this does and when to use it
   could easily do the same thing via RunCode
 - RunScript, it became superfluous after RunCode was implemented

AddWing now only appends '_wing' to its arguments after it fails without it
Improvements to the RunCode command:
 - Added Vector2f to default imports
 - RunCode can now use LazyLib's classes if LazyLib is tagged in the launcher
 - If an exception occurs, actual exception details are shown rather than the
   InvocationTargetException wrapper thrown by Janino's ScriptEvaluator

 1.5 (February 7, 2013)
========================
Toggleable combat commands can now be used on the campaign map
Certain non-combat commands can now be used in battles (Alias, GC, RunCode, etc)
You can now copy your console settings to a new savefile:
 (this process will be improved in future versions)
 - Step 1: start a new game without this mod active, save and quit
 - Step 2: activate this mod, load the save with the settings you want
 - Step 3: without exiting the game, load the new save from step 1
 - Step 4: use the AddConsole command to activate the console on that save

 1.4 (January 17, 2012)
========================
The cursor for the console pop-up is now visible
Fixed bug: exception details not displayed when an error occurs
RunCode works again (ignores separators, can't be used with other commands)
Multiple changes to the alias command:

In-battle commands are no longer reset after each battle
Active in-battle commands are listed at the start of combat and when toggled
Removed Unreveal command, Reveal is now a toggle
New in-battle commands:
 - God: Invincibility (somewhat buggy - heavy damage will instantly drop you to
   zero hull but you won't die, and you get a null crash when ramming ships)
 - InfiniteFlux: Gives all ships on your side infinite flux
