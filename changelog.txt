-> Removed "Defense Protocol", "High Value Munition" and "Burst" effects as they are now redundant.
-> Changed some modifiers to make them fit in line with bodies.

Modular Weapons (Beta):
-> All saved weapons will be wiped when updating (but hey atleast (probably) save compatible). This will also most definitly be the case for most future updates for the beta.

-> Added 4 new effects.

Version 1.3.1

Modular Weapons (Beta):
-> All saved weapons will be wiped when updating (but hey atleast (probably) save compatible)

-> Added a few new effects.
-> Added 4 more design slots.
-> Several balance adjustments. Not actually balanced, but there should be more options than just going for Burst now.
-> Flux useage should now show on the refit screen.
 - It still wont be perfectly accurate and there are some issues in the way of making the refit screen show the actual values.
-> Effects are now sorted based on Type and then also based on Cost.
-> Merged Quickloader and Autoloader.
-> Explosion effect now changes its size based on projectile size.

Misc:
-> Fixed an issue that caused some config changes to not be loaded on save reload.



Version 1.3.0 (Requires Lunalib 1.6.0 or higher)

>Added Modular Weapons (Beta)
Modular Weapons can be enabled from the configs. They are currenlty unbalanced, untested and unfinished, so they arent quite recommended if you want a quality playthrough, but feel like messing with a fun new thing.

How they work:
Once enabled, if you enter/reload a save, you will get the "Weapon Forge" ability. Use it to open the design screen. In there you can select different stats with a budget restraint for a weapon. Once you have something that you like, you can hold the "Finalize" button to finish the design. Once created, it cant be changed anymore for the entire duration of the save. Some may not like it, but it has its reason for API limitations that i am facing (Worst case you can still reload a prior save). Now you are able to craft the weapon and equip it. 

The Lunalib Debug menu also has a snippet that lets you reset all modular weapons, which would let you go around the "Modify once per save" Restriction.

Other:
-> Fixed a crash with lunalib, now requirs version 1.6.0 of it.
-> Fixed a crash related to the chiral system having no hyperspace anchor



Version 1.2.0

A decently sized patch that should improve the feel of outpost systems and adds some fun new content to them.

-> Outpost systems now only take up one system instead of an entire constellation (which it previously filled with filler).
-> Updated the config descriptions to match how chiral and outpost systems function now.
-> Outposts may spawn with the same faction multiple times now.
-> The Loot from outpost planets now doesnt give blueprints that the player knows by default anymore.
-> Fighting fleets in the outpost systems now has a way lower rep impact.
-> The secondary shipsystem hullmods can now only be applied to frigates, destroyers and cruisers.
-> The secondary shipsystems now require a story point to be installed.
-> Possibly fixed a rare crash.



Version 1.1.0

Important: This mod now requires the "Combat Activators" Library Mod, and to avoid bugs it requires the 1.0.2 version or above

-> Integrated "Combat Activators" mod.
-> Added a new bit of exploration content for the chiral system
-> Added a bar event that gives you the chiral systems location.

-> Outposts now generate after remnants and ruins, to ensure that they will never take any space reserved to them.
-> All chiral ships have have front-shields instead of omni shields, and have slightly reduced speeds.
