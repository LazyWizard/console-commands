command,class,tags,syntax,help
# Command: what the player enters to use your custom command
# Class: points towards the command's script, which should implement BaseCommand
# Tags: used by the Help command to find specific types of commands. Example tags:
#  Console - system-level commands such as Help or Status, will work everywhere
#  Campaign/Combat - this command only works in these contexts
#  A mod-specific tag - include your mod as a tag so Help can differentiate them! The console mod uses the "core" tag, so please don't use that tag in your mod
# Syntax: the syntax pattern for your command. <> denotes a required field, [] an optional one. Ex: "addcrew <amount> [optionalLevel]"
# Help: what the player is shown when they enter "help <command>". The syntax line will be shown by help as well, so you don't need to include it again.
#
