 STEP 1 - THE SCRIPT
=====================

all commands are implemented as separate Java classes. These classes must
implement the org.lazywizard.console.BaseCommand interface. This interface
contains only one method:
 - public CommandResult runCommand(String args, CommandContext context)

CommandResult is an enum included in BaseCommand. It has the following values:
   SUCCESS, returned when a command runs without error
   BAD_SYNTAX, return this if the player entered improperly formatted arguments
   WRONG_CONTEXT, if a command was entered in the wrong place (for example,
   ERROR, if a command used the proper syntax but still failed for some reason

CommandContext is also an enum in BaseCommand, and tells your script where this
command was used. It has the following values which should be self-explanatory:
   CAMPAIGN_MAP
   COMBAT_CAMPAIGN,
   COMBAT_MISSION,
   COMBAT_SIMULATION

 STEP 2 - THE CSV
==================

After you have implemented your command's code, you will need to register it
so the console can find and load it. To do so, you'll need to add your command
to data/console/commands.csv

This CSV file has the following rows:
Command: This is what the user enters to use your command.
Class: This points to the script you wrote in Step 1 above.
Tags: Used with the 'help' command to find specific commands easier. For
   example, 'help combat' will return a list of all commands with 'combat'
   as one of their tags. This doesn't affect how your command works at all.
Syntax: The basic instructions on how to use this command. Shown when a command
   returns CommandResult.BAD_SYNTAX, or as part of 'help <command>'
   <> - This denotes a required field
   [] - This denotes an optional field
Help: Detailed instructions on how to use a command. Shown with 'help <command>'

Command and Class are required. Tags, Syntax and Help are optional, but it is
HIGHLY recommended that you write something here unless this command is for
personal use only.
